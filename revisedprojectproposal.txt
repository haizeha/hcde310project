Initially, my project focused on developing a weather-based music recommendation system, designed to provide Seattle residents with music playlists depending on their moods and weather.
However, after further consideration and exploration of APIs, I decided to pivot the project to focus on building a cocktail recipe website using the TheCocktailDB API.
This shift allowed for a simpler but equally engaging user experience.
The revised project is a user-friendly platform where individuals who are interested in cocktails can easily search for cocktail recipes by name.
The website retrieves detailed cocktail information including ingredients, instructions, and an image.
This transition reflects my decision to focus on a less complex project that emphasizes clean design and smooth functionality.
